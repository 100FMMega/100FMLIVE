          <h3>Kiryandongo refugees fighting hunger with climate smart’s Pfumvudza Model</h3>
          <p class="news-preview">By Omony Denis</p>
          <button class="read-more" onclick="toggleStory(this)">Read More ▼</button>
          <div class="full-story">
            <p>Amidst the anxiety of displacement, erratic weather, and food insecurity, refugees in
Kiryandongo settlement are turning to a climate-resilient farming technique called Pfumvudza to
fight hunger and build resilience.
For families relying on dwindling food aid and limited land, growing their own food is not a luxury
but a vital necessity for survival.
In November 2024, Kiryandongo Agro Input Center Limited, an agro input dealer in Kiryandongo
district launched the use of Pfumvudza Model to promote optimal production of vegetables and
other food crops on the available plots..
The notable crops mostly grown under the model are sukumawiki, carrots, onions, tomatoes,
maize among others.
Since the introduction of this unique model, 860 refugees have been trained, and 12 Pfumvudza
demonstration plots established.
The plots are usually small ranging from as little as 6 by 6 meters to a maximum of 39 by 16
meters.
Pfumvudza emphasizes soil conservation through mulching with grass, and the application of
manure and fertilizer before planting seeds, which typically takes place one week after land
preparation.
Joyce Medina Benjamin, a South Sudanese refugee, is one of the beneficiaries of the
Pfumvudza model in the Kiryandongo refugee settlement.
“When we started using the model, we immediately began seeing the benefits, especially
because it suits our small pieces of land,” she said.
Medina, who has only half an acre for both her home and garden, said the Pfumvudza model
has made farming more practical and efficient.
As the leader of a group of farmers at the demonstration plot in Cluster L, she added that many
community members have already embraced and appreciated the approach.
“I see farmers already overjoyed by the positive impact of the Pfumvudza model,” Medina said.
“When you plant using this method, you harvest more food and many beneficiaries are even
selling part of their produce to meet other basic needs,” she added
According to the International Rescue Committee, the Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) rate in
Kiryandongo Refugee Settlement was estimated at 9.1 percent as of March 2024, just below the
World Health Organization&#39;s emergency threshold.
This high rate stems from compounding factors including disease, poor dietary intake, and
inadequate child‑feeding practices

However, through the Pfumvudza model, Medina was able to save money she had previously
spent on weeding, as the method significantly reduces weed growth.
“I have been using the extra money I save to provide nutritious food for my six children and also
pay their school fees something that was very difficult in the past,” Medina recounts.
She now plans to adopt the Pfumvudza model across all her gardens in the next planting
seasons.
“In every garden I open from next season onwards, I will embrace Pfumvudza because it gives
higher yields compared to the traditional way of farming,” she noted
William Mabende is another refugee in the Kiryandongo settlement who has also benefited from
the model.
William Mabende, who has lived in the Kiryandongo settlement since he was displaced by a
landslide in Mbale district in 2010, has long struggled to provide enough food for his family
which is now not that case.
He currently resides in Cluster D of the settlement. “What I have seen with this model is
impressive, the crops stay green and the yield is much better,” said Mabende.
Mabende explained that he used to cultivate two acres of maize and harvest only ten bags,
selling seven and keeping three for food.
“I am making a testament that with the Pfumvudza model, I now harvest up to 20 bags of maize
from just half an acre. To me, that’s a huge plus,” he added.
Despite the tedious work of collecting mulch and preparing the Pfumvudza garden, Mabende
remains satisfied with the model’s results.
“I used to spend at least UGX.120,000 on labor for weeding four times each season. Now, I only
weed once, which has helped me save about UGX. 70,000. I use the savings to buy other
vegetable seedlings and greens,” said Mabende.
Just like Madina and Mabende, Matha Nyakur Riek, is another refugee in Cluster L who also is
benefitting from Pfumvudza Model.
Upon realizing the benefits of the Pfumvudza model, Riek left her original group and opened her
own garden using the method.
“I used to farm the usual way in my 12 by 10 meters plot of land, but the constant frustration
nearly made me give up. Sometimes, I couldn’t even harvest a basin of produce from my plot,”
Riek shared while extending gratitude to Kiryandongo Agro Input Center Limited for the bailout.
Despite praising the project, refugees raised concerns about the tiring work involved in
collecting mulch, with some walking as far as two kilometers to find grass. They also noted that
the grass used for mulching often becomes a hideout for snakes.
Nalunkuma Halima, is the director of Kiryandongo Agro Input Center Limited.
She explained that the Pfumvudza model focuses on smallholder farmers most of whom were
allocated between half an acre to one acre of land.

This also explains why the refugees were targeted rather than host community members who
own large chunks of land some of which are not put to productive use.
“We have so far trained 860 refugees and established 12 demonstration farms in the refugee
settlement,” she confirmed.
Halima explained that the model follows the principles of conservation agriculture, including
careful planning, marking the size of the land to help farmers determine the number of seedlings
needed, and estimating the expected harvest.
She further added that the model incorporates the use of fertilizers and manure, which has
already resulted in improved yields among the beneficiaries.
“We have seen positive results for example, the half-acre plots are producing more from the
same portion of land compared to the traditional model,” she said.
On the challenge of sourcing mulch, Halima advised farmers to use alternative available
materials.
“We always implore them that maize stalks can be used as mulch instead of traveling over a
kilometer to find grass, and that they should also store mulch for future use instead of
destroying,” Halima said.
She expressed confidence that most farmers will adopt this model, especially since they have
already started seeing immediate benefits.
“For instance, during a drought that lasted over three weeks this season, many crops were
affected but Pfumvudza farmers were smiling because their crops remained healthy,” she
added.
Halima urged more farmers to embrace the Pfumvudza model, and for those unable to adopt it
fully, she encouraged them to embrace mulching practices to help mitigate the real effects of
environmental changes.
Barnard Savion Bukenya is the agricultural extension worker in charge of Bweyale Town
Council and Kiryandongo Refugee Settlement.
According to Bukenya, he had the opportunity to visit the demonstration farms, which
emphasize zero tillage, a practice he says has significantly increased crops yields among the
refugees.
“Just to remind you, these farmers practicing the Pfumvudza model didn’t even plant on time
last season, yet the yield they realized from their demonstration farms was much higher
compared to where the model was not practiced,” said Bukenya.
Similarly, Issa Hassan Byenkya, the district production officer for Kiryandongo, acknowledged
that the Pfumvudza model is a driving force in addressing food insecurity within the settlement.
“It’s clear that the model works. Anyone who has applied it and seen its efficiency in producing
better yields should be able to adopt it. It also addresses low income levels since farmers can
sell surplus produce,” he said.

Byenkya believes the model has arrived at the right time to tackle the food crisis among
refugees.
“The refugees currently face a major challenge as food aid has been drastically reduced by
more than half following the US Trump policy. Seeing them grow food they can rely on for both
cash and consumption is a huge relief,” according to Byenkya.

          <h3>Mechanized Agriculture: Nwoya Tractor Operators Reaping Big
</h3>
          <p class="news-preview">By Tolit Ivan

          <div class="full-story">
            <p> Dozens of Tractor operators in Nwoya District specializing in mechanized land preparation are reaping big from the trade.

Mechanized land preparation refers to the use of machinery to prepare land for planting crops.

This involves various operations like plowing, harrowing, and leveling, utilizing tractors, plows, harrows, and other farm implements.

It aims at improving soil quality, enhancing water and air circulation, controlling weeds and pests, and creating a favorable environment for crop growth.

According to a report by the Nwoya District Agricultural Department, the district has over 500 tractor operators providing services to the smallholder farmers to enhance their production in a move to boost their household income.

The report further revealed that 80% of 220,000 people of Nwoya district have embraced mechanized land preparation techniques through tractor usage.

Due to the growing population and demand for mechanized field opening and ploughing, the tractor operators in the district are in the limelight for their services.

The locals prefer the use of tractors for field opening and ploughing compared to the local methods of farming as of its cost effective and fast compared to other methods.

Samuel Rubangakene, a tractor operator based in Purongo Town Council, Nwoya District, said mechanized land preparation is a feasible business in the district due to its high demand.

Rubangakene said at times they are overwhelmed due to the high demand which suppressed the available tractors in the district.

According to Rubangakene, before joining the trade, his family were barely surviving but after joining the venture, the standard of living for his family has changed.

Rubangakene currently earns UGX 2 million on a daily basis during the farming season in land opening.

He said despite the business being viable, at times they are faced with numerous challenges when the tractor breaks down due to the lack of spare parts and mechanical engineers to fix the tractors.

Rubangakene also attributed the influx in the number of Kenyan tractors that are flooding the business and ploughing at cheaper rates between UGX 700,000-80,000 compared to UGX 100,000 price set by the locals as one of the stumbling blocks in the business.

Another tractor operator, Agenorwot Lydia, a resident of Lapono Village, Pabala Parish, Anaka Sub County, Nwoya District, said mechanized land preparation business restored hope in her life.

According to Agenorwot, before joining the trade in 2023, her family were struggling to make ends meet due to difficulties in accessing basic needs.
				
Agenorwot said during the farming season, they earn between UGX 2-3million from mechanized land preparation on a daily basis.

She said mechanized land preparation is a lucrative business due to its high demand urging people to join the venture.

Agenorwot however, stressed that they faced challenges in getting original spare parts when the tractors break down despite buying it very expensively saying it’s something affecting the business.

Tabu Justin, the Senior Agricultural Engineer Nwoya District, said mechanized land preparation has gained momentum in the district in the last 10 years due to its potential for increased efficiency, reduced labour, and improved crop yields.

According to Tabu, in the past most farmers were relying on rudimentary farming tools such as hand hoes, oxen and ox plough to mechanize their garden which was not reliable.
				
Tabu echoed that with the embracement of mechanized agriculture and land preparation by the locals in the district, the crop production and yields has seen a positive light.

 ‘’ You know; our land is actually so big that we cannot fully cultivate it. We cannot do well with hand hoe and even oxen, ox plough.  The land needs to be ploughed using tractors for the farmers to realize positive return from agriculture” said Tabu.

He however, said the biggest challenge the tractor operators are facing is mechanical breakdown and lack of experts in case of a mechanical problem since many of the tractor parts  are imported from outside the country.

Tabu urged companies dealing in tractors and its accessories to set up their shops and warehouses in the district.

 Mbabazi Joan, the Director of Shalom Ventures, a Company dealing in Tractor spare parts in Nwoya District, said the adoption of mechanized land preparations techniques by smallholder farmers has boosted the business.

According to Mbabazi, with the shift from traditional farming methods to mechanized agriculture, the sale of tractor spare parts in the region has skyrocketed.

Mbabazi advised the farmers in the region to embrace mechanized farming in order to earn big from agriculture since it is cost effective, efficient and reduces the labor force.

The Ugandan government is promoting agricultural mechanization, including mechanized land preparation to increase efficiency, productivity, and ultimately improving on farmer’s incomes.

The shift is driven by the need to modernize agriculture, address labor shortages, and mitigate the effects of climate change.

The shift also aims to replace traditional methods like ox-ploughs, particularly in rural areas, and increase land usage, production, and overall efficiency.
